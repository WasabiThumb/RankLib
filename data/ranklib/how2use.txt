// Making Ranks \\
To make a rank, go to ranklist.txt and copy one of the lines and paste it in the one under.
Make sure there is always a comma at the end and it is always BEFORE "autofill_highest".
Keep "autofill_highest" true if you want the server owner and superadmins to have the rank at the bottom of the list.
Replace true with "admin" (with quotations) if you want the server owner, superadmins, AND admins to access the role bottom of the list.
Replace true with false if you want only those who match the prequisites you set in "preqs.txt".

// Prequisites \\
Insert one of these types in quotations next to each number (which corresponds with the numbers on the rank list).
1 cannot be edited because it is user default.

Types:
"adset" - Can only be obtained by being set by an admin with "ranklib_set <name> <rank number>"
<number> - Insert an unquoted number here. If a user has that number of frags, then they are granted access to that rank.

// Permissions \\
Go into the "perms" folder. Make a text file for each number, including 1.

perms>"1.txt"
perms>"2.txt"
etc...

There should allready be a template there by the name "permtemplate.txt". Copy the contents into each file and fill out the inside form.
