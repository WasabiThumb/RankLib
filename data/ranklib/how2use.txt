// Making Ranks \\
To make a rank, go to ranklist.txt and copy one of the lines and paste it in the one under.
Make sure there is always a comma at the end and it is always BEFORE "autofill_highest".
Keep "autofill_highest" true if you want the server owner and superadmins to have the rank at the bottom of the list.
Replace true with "admin" (with quotations) if you want the server owner, superadmins, AND admins to access the role bottom of the list.
Replace true with false if you want only those who match the prequisites you set in "preqs.txt".

// Permissions \\
Go into the "perms" folder. Make a text file for each number, including 1.

perms>"1.txt"
perms>"2.txt"
etc...

There should allready be a template there by the name "permtemplate.txt". Copy the contents into each file and fill out the inside form.

// Setting Ranks \\
In console, rlib_set <player> <id>

Only superadmins can use this command.
If you want to trust admins to use this command, modify lua/autorun/server/rlib.lua
